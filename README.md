# What is This
This is a Matlab implementation of our paper ***Improving Object Retrieval Quality by Integration of Similarity Propagation and Query Expansion***. Noting that in our paper, we combined our re-rank method with four different image search approaches, namely, BOW, TEMB, RMAC and ASMK*. While this repository is an example Â of **RMAC**. If you want to use our re-rank method in other approaches, please add `cast_rerank.m` function after initial rank step as in `test_ramc.m`.
