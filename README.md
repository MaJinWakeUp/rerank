# What is This
This is a Matlab implementation of our paper ***"Improving Object Retrieval Quality by Integration of Similarity Propagation and Query Expansion"***. Noting that in our paper, we combined our re-rank method with four different image search approaches, namely, BOW, TEMB, RMAC and ASMK. While this repository is an example Â of **RMAC**. If you want to use our re-rank method in other approaches, please add `cast_rerank.m` function after initial rank step as in `test_ramc.m`.

# Setup
## Dependence
* [Matconvnet][1]. This is a MATLAB toolbox implementing CNNs for computer vision applications.
* Optional but recommended: [Library yael][2]. Yael is a library implementing computationally intensive functions used in large scale image retrieval. Functions needed in this experiment are already contained in folder `utils`.
## Dataset
* Oxford5k.
